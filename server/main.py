How can employees or contractors add hours that were missed on a processed payment? Admins will need to process an off-cycle payroll including the missed hours or catch-up on the following payroll.

The pay schedule must be updated so that the pay period is in arrears, meaning the pay period end-date must occur before the processing deadline. If there are only contractors, this will not be an issue. There are two paths for updating the pay schedule to arrears: Single pay schedule: update the pay schedule to arrears (this will change the pay schedule for both hourly and salaried employees) Multiple pay schedules: create an hourly pay schedule with arrears for hourly employees only  ",

The key difference between an independent contractor and an employee is that for contractors, a client has no legal right to dictate how, when, or where the work will be completed . An employer can require that their employees work at an office in-person two days per week. But a company cannot require that a contractor complete their work at a certain time of day, for example. Many contractors are location-independent for this reason. This is the main difference between contractors and employees. But there are other differences as well, which we will get into later. Notably, all contractors are contingent workers, but only some contingent workers are contractors.  ",
